doc package version 3
=================================================

This is an updated version of the doc package from the LateX kernel
incorporating work by Didier Verna (dox package) and integrating
hypdoc by Heiko Oberdiek.

This is work in progress so not really meant for usage right now-

This package is set up to produce two PDF files: one including the
user documentation for the package, and the second, with ‘`-code`’
suffix, which includes both the user documentation and the typeset
package code.  Note that these are produced by the two `.tex` files,
which simply set typesetting options and read in the `.dtx` docstrip
file so only one source file needs to be maintained.
