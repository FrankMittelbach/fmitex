# widows-and-orphans

Automatically identifying widows and orphans in a document

This package will identify all widows and orphans in a document to help a user to get rid of them. The act of resolving still needs to be done manually: By rewriting text, running some paragraph long or short or or explicitly breaking in some strategic place.

 The initial idea came about way back in 2012 when somebody on stackexchange asked if it would be possible to [Find all widows and orphans](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/45528/finding-all-widows-and-orphans).

The package for CTAN will have a few more bells and whistles.
