# fewerfloatpages package

-----

This package implements float algorithm extension for handling float
pages. It attempts to reduce the number of unnecessary (fairly empty)
float pages while making sure that floats nevertheles stay close to
their call-outs. Several aspects of the algorithm behavior are
adjustable.
