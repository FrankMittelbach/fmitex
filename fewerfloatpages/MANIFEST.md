# Manifest for fewerfloatpages

This file is a listing of all files considered to be part of this package.
It is automatically generated with `texlua build.lua manifest`.


## Repository manifest

The following groups list the files included in the development repository of the package.
Files listed with a ‘†’ marker are included in the TDS but not CTAN files, and files listed
with ‘‡’ are included in both.

### Source files

These are source files for a number of purposes, including the `unpack` process which
generates the installation files of the package. Additional files included here will also
be installed for processing such as testing.

* fewerfloatpages.dtx ‡
* fewerfloatpages.ins ‡
* l3doc-TUB.cls ‡

### Typeset documentation source files

These files are typeset using LaTeX to produce the PDF documentation for the package.

* fewerfloatpages-code.tex ‡
* fewerfloatpages-doc.tex ‡

### Text files

Plain text files included as documentation or metadata.

* MANIFEST.md ‡
* README.md ‡
* changes.txt ‡

### Derived files

The files created by ‘unpacking’ the package sources. This typically includes
`.sty` and `.cls` files created from DocStrip `.dtx` files.

* fewerfloatpages.sty †

### Typeset documents

The output files (PDF, essentially) from typesetting the various source, demo,
etc., package files.

* fewerfloatpages-code.pdf ‡
* fewerfloatpages-doc.pdf ‡

### Test files

These files form the test suite for the package. `.lvt` or `.lte` files are the individual
unit tests, and `.tlg` are the stored output for ensuring changes to the package produce
the same output. These output files are sometimes shared and sometime specific for
different engines (pdfTeX, XeTeX, LuaTeX, etc.).
