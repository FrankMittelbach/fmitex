Assorted TeX packages

Assorted LaTeX packages (well one day ...) written or maintained by
me, but aren't in the core LaTeX.  Also the place for trial work that
will eventually go to CTAN or into the main LaTeX distribution (and
that way to CTAN). Thus packages should normally be obtained from CTAN
rather than from here. However development versions obtained from
github may sometimes be in advance of the CTAN release.

Issues and comments may also be left on the packages using the github
issue tracker.
